 # Two ways of define route/ API endpoints handlers;
 1. File based route handler within api folder in app dir.
 2. Create a direct route handler within app directory:-
    in this approch we have to  create special route.js file which act as backend API route
    you can't use route.js in nextjs page route directory.( both(page route and nodejs backend route) may be clashed becuase of same endpoint).
